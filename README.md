## Background

My preferred method of study has always been to get an overview of a subject,
and building up my knowledge from foundations. I do not think this has served me
well – I often get bogged down before making any progress.

My plan with this repo is to record the daily, bite-size chunks I learn every
day and build up towards mastery in a subject by jumping around in the subject a
little, and hoping to build up the big picture that way.


## Goals

Current learning goals:

* Spanish 🇪🇸
* JavaScript 👾
* Classical mechanics ☄️
* Enough maths to help understand classical mechanics ∂
