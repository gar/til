For any triangle with the sides a, b and c, and angles A, B and C, the following
holds true:

    a       b       c
  ----- = ----- = -----
  sin A   sin B   sin C

This is called the *Law of sines* and it can be used to figure out missing
angles or sides in a triangle (as long as you know two sides and an angle, or
two angles and a side).

This can be proved for two angles and two sides by relating them to an altitude
dropped between them.
